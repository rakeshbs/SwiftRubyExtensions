This is an attempt to make  Apple's Swift classes even better by adding some of the awesome convenience functions that are present in Ruby.

For example : Like in Ruby, Appending to an array is as simple as

	var a = [1,2,3,4]
	// Use << operator to append to the end of the array

	a << 5
	a << [6,7,8,9]

Please check out main.swift file for more examples.
